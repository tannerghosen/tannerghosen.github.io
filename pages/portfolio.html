        <p>This is a password management program made using WinForms in C# & .NET. The program saves account info added to this program in a .wasspord file with a user's name of choice. Attached to these files can be a password to unlock the file for future use. All passwords, including the one to unlock the program, are encrypted into the file so that it cannot be easily decrypted without the program. As bonus features, Wasspord comes with a password generator, password validator, miscellaneous settings, and autosaving functionality.</p>
